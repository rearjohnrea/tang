					<h2>The Finals</h2>
					<p>
						The 2017 NBA Finals was the championship series of the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s 2016–17 season and conclusion of the season's playoffs. The Western Conference champion Golden State Warriors defeated the defending NBA champion and Eastern Conference champion Cleveland Cavaliers 4 games to 1. This Finals was the first time in NBA history the same two teams had met for a third consecutive year. The Cavaliers sought to repeat as champions after winning the championship in 2016, while the Warriors won the first meeting in 2015. Golden State earned home court advantage with a 2016–17 regular season record of 67–15, while Cleveland finished the regular season with a 51–31 record. The Warriors entered the 2017 Finals after becoming the first team in NBA playoff history to start 12–0, while the Cavaliers entered the 2017 Finals with a 12–1 record during the first three rounds of the postseason. The Warriors' 15–0 start in the playoffs is the most consecutive postseason wins in NBA history and their 16–1 record is the best winning percentage (.941) in NBA Playoff history.

The Cavs opened the game on 7-2 run. Then, the Warriors found their groove. Stephen Curry scored all nine of his first quarter points in a span of 4:15, a stretch in which the Warriors regained the lead by way of an 11-1 run. Then, Andre Iguodala took the reigns. After missing his first three shots of the game, Iguodala sank three of his next four, including a three-pointer to put the Dubs up 23-15 with just over two minutes left in the period.."><img src="img/2016-CurryKyrie-1280.jpg?image=250" width="100%"></a>

After 40 years of waiting and a season in which they won 67 regular season games, set countless franchise and league records, the Golden State Warriors are now NBA Champions."><img src="img/150617055829-andre-iguodala-stephen-curry-kiss-trophy-finals-061715.home-t3.jpeg?image=250" width="100%">
